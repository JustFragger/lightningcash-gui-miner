This is a GUI wrapper made with VB .net for a yespowerltncg cpuminer. 
Rather than enter arguments on the command line, or create a batch file, the user can just open the program and fill the fields.

## How To Use
Open the program, enter the number of threads to use (probably 1-4, maybe 8 or 16 if you have really nice cpu), 
the mining pool (and port) you'd like to use, and *your lightningcash wallet address*, and then press start mining. 
The miner should stop if you press stop mining or if you exit the program 
(if it crashes you may need to ctrl-alt-del and kill the cpuminer.exe process using task manager, but I don't think this should occur). 
Be aware that this is alpha quality software, so the paranthetical in the previous sentence may not be accurate.
